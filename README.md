# NooGlow

NooGlow is a daily wellness challenge app to help prioritize Nooglers' (new Googlers) well-being. As Nooglers are embarking on an exciting new adventure in their careers, it's essential to practice self-care. These daily challenges will provide Nooglers with tools and resources to establish healthy habits and maintain a balanced lifestyle.

## Description


I developed Nooglow using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, drawing inspiration from Google's Android Basics with Compose course here: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course. 

The idea behind this wellness app emerged from Google's extensive resources for employee well-being. To enhance user experience, I organized the 30 wellness activities into weekly challenges, facilitating seamless navigation through diverse well-being practices.

Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges, primarily stemming from my limited understanding of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Notably, I grappled with effectively collapsing the descriptions and checkboxes of activities during page changes. Additionally, I faced difficulties in storing and retrieving the user's name from the home screen to the app screen.

Looking ahead, I aim to implement a ViewModel to manage checkbox states, ensuring that completed cards remain collapsed even when users navigate away. Furthermore, I plan to enhance user convenience by persisting the app screen state, allowing users to resume from where they left off without re-entering their name. Additionally, I envision incorporating a progress bar to provide users with a visual representation of their completed challenges, fostering a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

## How to Use NooGlow

On the home screen, take a moment to read about the purpose of Nooglow, and then enter your name to kick off your wellness journey. 

On page 1, which features week one's wellness challenges, be sure to scan the how-to guide that will walk you through using the app. You'll encounter a wellness activity for each day of the week. To read more about an activity and access recommendations from Google, simply hit the arrow button. When you've completed an activity, click the checkbox to indicate your accomplishment and collapse it.

At the bottom of each week's screen, you can easily navigate from week to week. Additional challenges await you in week 5. Here's to embracing self-care!

### Organization + Planning

To organize and plan the creation of NooGlow, I first began by making a draft list of actions I needed to take Before, During, and After I begin coding. I organized my list using Trello; my board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/jckehlaB/nooglow-hackathon-project

Then, I began wireframing my app in Figma. I created six iterations, including the color palette, home screen, app screen, and the logo for the top app bar and Android phone icon.
